## Redstone Bells Plugin for Spigot / Bukkit
This plugin adds redstone behavior to the new 1.14 Bell blocks similar to how it works on Pocket Edition.
Each time there is a BlockRedstoneEvent it looks for a bell nearby according to each redstone activating block's behavior and if it finds one, it makes it ring visibly and audibly for all nearby players.
